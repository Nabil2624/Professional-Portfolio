                My journey at Helwan University has been a story of growth and discovery. 
                From the very first semester, I was fascinated by programming and problem-solving, 
                and each year brought new challenges that pushed me to think deeper. 
                I built lasting friendships, worked on exciting projects, and learned to collaborate as part of a team. 
                These years have shaped not just my technical skills, but also my resilience, creativity, and confidence as a computer scientist.
